= Ang Ze Yu - Project Portfolio for _TravelPal_
:site-section: AboutUs

== Overview

My team and I were tasked with enhancing, or morphing an existing _address book_ application, built on JavaFX, for our software engineering
project.

We chose the latter, which's end end product was _TravelPal_,  a desktop travelling companion application catered
for leisure travellers. This application allows travellers to manage their travelling itinerary, bookings, expenses and inventory
conveniently in one place, while also providing various other features catered to leisure travellers.

As per the constraint given to us in developing this project, the user interacts with _TravelPal_ mainly using a command line interface (CLI),
although it has user interface alternatives for most of its operations.

My main role was to develop the *diary* feature, which allows the user to store and edit memorable details of their
trip with both multimedia and text.



== Summary of contributions

* *Main contribution*: added the *diary* feature.
+

** What it does: Overall, this feature allows the user to key in memorable details of his / her travels, and store multimedia such
as photos of the trip, displayed in a user friendly and eye-catching format.
** Justification: Leisure travellers often want to reminisce on previous trips they have made long after the trip,
or share its details with friends and loved ones.
** Highlights: Due to the large amounts of displayable multimedia, the user interface of this feature was most
challenging to implement, requiring much analysis and consideration
in striking a balance between code performance and organization.

* *Second Main Contribution*: Base _address book_ code refactor
** What: Refactored all of the `logic` code component of the base _address book_ code for common use in _TravelPal_,
along with several `ui` components.
** Justification: Although the code base given to us was extensive, many of the common functionality we had in mind for
_TravelPal_, such as the ability to switch between pages of the application, was not immediately implementable from _address book_.
** Highlights: In considering the common functionality needed by the team, it was challenging to find solutions to
build upon the existing code rather than make intrusive code changes. Given the limited time frame of our project, it was crucial that
we utilised much of the existing code to speed our development process.

* *Third Main Contribution*: Implemented the base trip manager and preferences screens
+

** What: The trip manager allows the user to create and delete trips, and serves as the entry point into a single trip's
sub-features. The preferences screen allows the user to change several configuration options in the application without having to go into the
`json` text configuration file to edit it.
other sub-features.
** Justification: These were common features required before the team commence on developing their own sub-features. Moreover,
having the ability to edit configurations in the application saves the user from having to go manually edit the configuration files
on their system manually, which can be daunting.
