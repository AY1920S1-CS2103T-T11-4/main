== Overview

My team and I were tasked with enhancing, or morphing an existing _address book_ application, built on JavaFX, for our software engineering
project.

We chose the latter, which's end product was _TravelPal_,  a desktop travelling companion application catered
for leisure travellers. This application allows travellers to manage their travelling itinerary, bookings, expenses and inventory
conveniently in one place, while also providing various other features catered to leisure travellers.

As per the constraint given to us in developing this project, the user interacts with _TravelPal_ mainly using a command line interface (CLI),
although it has user interface alternatives for most of its operations.

My main role was to develop the *diary* feature, which allows the user to store and edit memorable details of their
trip with both multimedia and text.



== Summary of contributions

==== Main contribution 1: Implemented the diary feature.

image::diary/userguide/welcome_to_diary_image.png[width="90%" align="center"]
* What it does: Overall, this feature allows the user to key in memorable details of his / her travels, and store multimedia such
as photos of the trip, displayed in a user friendly and eye-catching format.
* Justification: Leisure travellers often want to reminisce on previous trips they have made long after the trip,
or share its details with friends and loved ones.
* Highlights: Due to the large amounts of displayable multimedia, the user interface of this feature was most
challenging to implement, requiring much analysis and consideration
in striking a balance between code performance and organization. To ensure support for a range of multimedia in the future,
the implementation user interface implementation also had to be highly extensible.

==== Main Contribution 2: Base _address book_ code refactor

* What: Refactored all of the `logic` code component of the base _address book_ code for common use in _TravelPal_,
along with several `ui` components.
* Justification: Although the code base given to us was extensive, many of the common functionality we had in mind for
_TravelPal_, such as the ability to switch between pages of the application, was not immediately implementable from _address book_.
* Highlights: In considering the common functionality needed by the team, it was challenging to find solutions to
build upon the existing code rather than make intrusive code changes. Given the limited time frame of our project, it was crucial that
we utilised much of the existing code to speed our development process.

'''

==== Main Contribution 3: Implemented the base trip manager screen

* What: The trip manager allows the user to create and delete trips, and serves as the entry point into a single trip's
sub-features.
other sub-features.
* Justification: As the application entry point, the trip manager was required before the team commence on developing
their own sub-features.

* *Other contributions*:

** Idea generation:
*** Contributed main idea of _TravelPal_ and its various sub-features (itinerary, diary, expenses, etc.) during project
inception, which the team agreed upon. (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mKmIZghbtYwgSWdDTiRQDLdXjKNhjuys8uSO8Y6McyI/edit[travelpal idea generation google docs])
** Enhancements to existing features
*** Enhanced navigation bar icon looks https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-4/main/pull/68[#68]

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.3` (4 releases) on GitHub: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-4/main/releases[releases]
*** Maintained issue tracker for milestones `1.1` through `1.4` https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-4/main/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed[issues]
** Tools:
*** Set up several continuous integration services (appveyor, coveralls)
*** Set up team github organization and repo


== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|
In developing _TravelPal_, a completely new user guide was needed to provide usage instructions for the various new features.

Shown below is one of the various sections I contributed to the User Guide,
on adding a photo inside the *diary* feature.

NOTE: See the <<UserGuide#, user guide>> for this usage scenario, not included in this project portfolio page.



== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|
In the course of this project, my team and I realised we developed a substantial amount
of code on top of the code base given to us.
Hence, my team and I updated the _TravelPal_ developer guide to better suit our needs.

Below is one of the various sections I contributed, documenting the aspect
of the diary that stores and displays photos.

== Conclusion

Developing _TravelPal_ under the various constraints given to us proved to be challenging. Of particular
note was our inexperience in building an application on top of a given code base.

Nonetheless, using my prior experience of developing organized code, I was able to contribute and implement various suggestions
which resulted in a highly extensible code base, easing the team development process.

Through thoroughly practicing the striking a balance between the various
guidelines and principles of good software engineering during this project,
I have also which would be my key takeaway from this.
