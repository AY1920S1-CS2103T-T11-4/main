== Portfolio Overview

This project portfolio page documents my contribution to the team project __TravelPal__. The page includes an overview of
the project, summary of the features I have implemented and other contributions, such as User Guide and Developer Guides.

== About our Project
The application developed by our team, _TravelPal_, is an all-in-one trip planner which provides frequent leisure travellers
with a highly customisable, intuitive and integrated trip management system. We aim to ease pre-trip planning process
with features such as trip itinerary and expense manager, and offer a platform for users to record their trip highlights
with our diary feature.

As _TravelPal_ is for those who prefer using the keyboard over a mouse, it uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) for keyboard input, but it also provide alternative input with mouse. As for output, it is displayed in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) - which is a display that includes panes, menus and message boxes. We believe such implementation makes our application more user-friendly.



== Summary of contributions

This section encompasses an overview of my contribution to the TravelPal application, including the summary of my code
implementation and how they add value to the application in terms of functionality and user experience.


==== Major enhancements: Implemented the _Expense Manager_ feature.

I implemented the complete _Expense Manager_ feature and handled the expenditures of trips.

image::expense/PPP/ExpenseManagerDays1.png[width="90%" align="center"]
* *What it does*: the _Expense Manager_ allows users to micromanage a list of expenses. User can choose to manually add a new
expense to a day or include an expense when adding an event in trip itinerary. All expenses will be displayed according
to the days, and a summary of the daily expenses and the total expenses for the trip will be displayed.
* *Justification*: This is one of the most useful features for pre-trip planning. A potential user may use the manager
to keep track of their estimated expenses, compare it with the budget and adjust their schedules accordingly.
* *Highlights*: This enhancement requires understanding of other features as the expenses needs to be updated whenever
there is a change in trip events. The expenses also need to be grouped under each days. Therefore, I had to make sure
that the interactions between event class, day list and expenses are bug-free and efficient.
* *Credits*: I used the concepts and logic from the existing code of address book to implement my features.

==== Second enhancements: Implemented the _Currency Manager_ feature.

I added a currency feature which allows users to create and select customised currency with exchange rate.

* *What it does*: the _Currency_ feature allows users to add and select currencies with customised currency name, symbol and
exchange rate. When a currency is selected, all the monetary valued will be displayed in that currency.

* *Justification*: Given the limited domestic tourism size, currency conversion is very relevant to travellers in Singapore.
International travellers may want to view the expenses in local currency so that our trip manager can be more intuitive and easy to use.

* *Highlights*: To help users type currency symbols more efficiently, I added a list of preset currency symbols with index. This feature allows
 users to simply enter an index, which is automatically converted into currency symbols. The implementation demands effective handling of javafx.

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|
In developing __TravelPal__, a completely new user guide was needed to provide usage instructions for the various new features.

Shown below is one of the various sections I contributed to the User Guide,
on adding a photo inside the *diary* feature.

NOTE: See the https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-t11-4.github.io/main/UserGuide.html[user guide] for this usage scenario, not included in this project portfolio page.



== Contributions to the Developer Guide

This section displays the section of User Guide relating to the expense manager and currency customisation, created and edited by me.

== Conclusion

Development of __TravelPal__ is one of my first brown-field software engineering projects. During the process, I have gained many
useful programming knowledge and consolidated my understanding of application design. It has been an educational and rewarding team working
experience.
